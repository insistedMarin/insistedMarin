# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in web development and cloud technologies.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python, Java, Go
- **Frameworks**:Spring Boot, Angular, React, Django
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS

## My Work

- [AI Image search engine](https://github.com/insistedMarin/Image-Search-System-Using-CLIP-Model)
  
  Construct Open AI's **CLIP** model into a docker image, and use it to construct an image search engine, using a cloud-native development method. My model image is public and everyone is welcome to use it.
  This system mainly demonstrates the basic architecture of an AI-based image search engine. If it is a production environment, please use a vector search engine for optimization, such as **Elastic Search**, **Faiss**.
  
- [Trading System](https://github.com/insistedMarin/Transaction-Spring)

  A real-time trading system that taught me a lot. **Spring Cloud** is used to implement the microservice architecture,**kafka** message queue implements decoupling between services, **redis** implements transaction snapshots, API gateway implementation, websocket implements server message push, and we can write our own ORM framework.

- [Online Reading](https://github.com/insistedMarin/online-reading)

  An online library sounds very cool, but what is more interesting is that this project will let us learn more, how to quickly search documents? ElasticSearch is undoubtedly the first choice. The flashback indexing mechanism allows us to quickly find relevant documents through keywords. The only problem is, it's too heavy (local deployment puts my laptop through the paces). Fortunately, we can experience **Elastic Cloud** for 7 days to explore Elastic Search and **Kibana**. As well as **logstash** and **various connectors** to ensure data synchronization.
